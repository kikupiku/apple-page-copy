This is part of the Odin Project CSS/HTML curriculum.
The page is a copy of [this page](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/).
The focus of this project was gradients in the navigation bar. I tried to pay close attention to detail so most animations and behaviors of page elements are consistent with the original.

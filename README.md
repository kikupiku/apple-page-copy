### APPLE PAGE COPY

This project is part of [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s CSS/HTML curriculum.

The page is a copy of [this page](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/).

The focus of this project was gradients in the navigation bar. I tried to pay close attention to detail so most transitions and sizes of page elements are consistent with the original.

Live version of the project available **[HERE](https://kikupiku.github.io/apple-page-copy/)**
